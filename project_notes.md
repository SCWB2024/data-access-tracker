Project: Data Access TrackerIntroductionThis project is a Flask-based web application designed to serve as a centralized system for tracking and managing data access within an organization. It provides distinct functionalities for two types of users: administrators and standard users. The application's core purpose is to maintain a clear, auditable history of data access events, enhancing data governance and security.Key FeaturesUser Authentication and Management: The system includes a secure login and registration system. Administrators have an admin_dashboard to manage user accounts, including updating roles, enabling/disabling accounts, and resetting passwords.Data Access Logging: Standard users can log their data access with details like the dataset name, purpose, and timestamp. This creates an immutable record of all access events.Role-Based Access Control (RBAC): The application implements RBAC to ensure users only see and interact with features relevant to their roles. For example, only administrators can view the full access_history log.Password Management: The application includes a robust password reset feature that sends a secure, time-limited token to a user's email address, allowing them to reset a forgotten password without administrator intervention.Auditable History: The access_history page provides administrators with a paginated and searchable log of all data access events, which can be exported as a CSV file for auditing and reporting purposes.Learning and Resources: The learning_and_resources.html page serves as a central knowledge base, providing users with information on how to use the application and answers to frequently asked questions.Technologies UsedBackend: Flask, a lightweight Python web framework.Database: SQLAlchemy for database management and SQLite for the local development database.Frontend: Bootstrap for a responsive and modern user interface, Font Awesome for icons, and Chart.js for data visualization on the Admin Dashboard.Email: Flask-Mail for handling password reset emails.This application provides a foundation for a complete data access governance tool, with a clear separation of concerns and a user-friendly interface.
